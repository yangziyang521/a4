Code breaking is far from a solitary endeavor, and in many ways it's the opposite of genius. Or, rather: Genius itself is often a collective phenomenon. Success in code breaking depends on flashes of inspiration, yes, but it also depends on the careful maintaining of files, so that a coded message that has just arrived can be compared to a similar message that came in six months ago. Code breaking during World War II was a gigantic team effort. The war's cryptanalytic achievements were what Frank Raven, a renowned naval code breaker from Yale who supervised a team of women, called "crew jobs." These units were like giant brains; the people working in them were a living, breathing, shared memory. Codes are broken not by solitary individuals but by groups of people trading pieces of things they have learned and noticed and collected, little glittering bits of numbers and other useful items they have stored up in their heads like magpies, things they remember while looking over one another's shoulders, pointing out patterns that turn out to be the key that unlocks the code.
